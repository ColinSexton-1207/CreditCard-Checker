# CreditCard-Checker

This projet's purpose is to learn Javascript syntax with the help of Codecademy. The project is made in order to check valid credit card numbers, find invalid credit card numbers, and pinpoint which companies the cards belong to. This project is excellent in learning how to work with nested arrays, and introduction to programming an algorithm, and it's something that is great to do in any new language the developer may attempt to learn.
I'd like to note, this is a project that will have some minor tweaks added to it. Currently, the debugging code and comments are still within the code, but that will be removed in further revisions. Additional functions may be added at a later time in order to expand the project.

Disclaimer: These functions had limited explanations in the course, and left the problem-solving and programming up to the developer. I have added some additional items, such as returning the origianl credit card arrays back to their original order after modifying them in the validate section.
